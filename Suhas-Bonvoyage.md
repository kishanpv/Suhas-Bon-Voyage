Mama is the feeling of a warm room on a cold day🥰. Always lighting up the room with just his presence. The joker, the care taker and the only person I go to when I want ice cream😋. I hope your life in Germany blooms and, Janya and Tapasvi come back with a German accent, and you come back with Nutella every year🥹. Love you mama forever in our hearts🌷

We’ll miss you, but we’re cheering for you every step of the way 🥰

ನಿನ್ನ ನಗು, ಮಾತುಗಳು ಮತ್ತು ಖುಷಿ ನಮಗೆ ತುಂಬಾ ಮಿಸ್ ಆಗುತ್ತವೆ.  

ಯಾರೇ ಇದ್ದರೂ ಕ್ಷಣದಲ್ಲೇ ಸ್ನೇಹಿತರನ್ನಾಗಿ ಮಾಡಿಕೊಳ್ಳುತ್ತೀಯ.  

ನೀನು ಇದ್ದರೆ ಎಲ್ಲೆಡೆ ಖುಷಿಯ ವಾತಾವರಣ ಇರುತ್ತಿತ್ತು.  

ಹೊಸ ಪ್ರಯಾಣಕ್ಕೆ ಹೊರಟಿರುವ ನಿನಗೆ ನಮ್ಮ ಪ್ರೀತಿ ಸದಾ ಜೊತೆಯಾಗಿರಲಿ.  

ಹೊಸ ಜಾಗದಲ್ಲೂ ಇದೇ ಖುಷಿ ಮತ್ತು ಸಡಗರದಿಂದ ಇರು..❤️

Don’t recall when or where this was taken. But the goofy faces make total sense. This is the side of me that came out around Suhas. A fun, free side. I have no doubt he still has this effect on everyone around him; just by being his fun, free self.  

Congrats to Suhas, Shilpa and the kids. Best of luck in this new chapter of life.  

**Deutschland hat Glück, Suhas und seine Familie als Gäste zu haben!**

Suhas is the kind of person everyone loves to have in the room! With his cheerful and talkative nature, he doesn't just enter a room; he transforms it! His ability to keep things lighthearted is a gift to those around him. Balancing the needs of a family (as a son, husband, and father) while maintaining a professional edge as an employee is no small feat. It shows immense character and heart!  

May your laughter never fade, your jokes always find their mark, and your life remain as vibrant and fulfilling as the joy you give to others. Wishing you boundless success and happiness in every role you play! 😊💐
